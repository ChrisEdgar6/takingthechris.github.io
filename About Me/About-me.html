                        <p class="info">Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Chris Edgar, I grew up in a small village called Hawarden on the border of North Wales just outside Chester. This is where I attended school and sixth form and from here went on to study Business Management at the Manchester Metropolitan University.</p>
                        <p class="info">Since graduating from University I have worked in the financial sector since 2013 in a variety of different roles and departments. In one of my roles as a Continuous Improvement Co-ordinator I was introduced to the notion of web design but it wasn't until the first national covid lockdown in March 2020 that I decided to delve further in to the coding world and really plough on to learn a multitude of different coding languages.</p>
                        <p class="info">At present, I have just began a new role as a Front End Developer based in the North West of England just outside of Liverpool. I have always wanted to create my own website and showcase my skills and abilities to do so and therefore decided to give it a go by creating this site. The site will consist of articles based on a variety of topics that I have wanted to research and understand more of, encompassing my interests based around sport, music, business and technology. This will therefore be what most of my article topics will be about.</p>
                        <p class="info">The site name was chosen to be a play on words for the consumer of this site to take on board my opinions on an array of different subjects and therefore on all of my articles you will be 'Taking the Chris'.</p>
                        <p class="info">On a more personal note, my partner and I have recently welcomed our baby daughter to the world who has inspired me to grab every opportunity that life throws at you and to hopefully become someone she and her Mum can be proud of. As a result this meant that I finally took the leap to leave a comfortable job and jump in to a career that I have dreamt of doing for a number of years.</p>
                        <p class="info">Thanks again for visiting my site and I hope you enjoy reading the articles I have written and feel free to get in touch!</p>
